# RVC Implementation

Welcome to the **RVC Implementation** repository! This project focuses on implementing and exploring robust voice conversion (RVC) techniques for transforming one speaker's voice into another while preserving naturalness and intelligibility. This implementation is designed for researchers and developers interested in working with voice conversion technologies.

## Overview
Voice conversion (VC) is the process of modifying a source speaker's voice to sound like a target speaker while maintaining the content and naturalness. This repository provides an implementation of RVC using modern deep learning techniques, optimized for flexibility and extensibility.

## Features
- **High-Quality Voice Conversion**: Leverages state-of-the-art techniques for natural and intelligible voice conversion.
- **Speaker Adaptation**: Customizes models to specific speaker pairs for better results.
- **Flexible Training Pipeline**: Supports custom datasets and training configurations.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Includes tools for evaluating conversion quality and intelligibility.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or later
- GPU with CUDA support (recommended)
- Libraries: PyTorch, NumPy, SciPy, etc.

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/G1290-hik/RVC_Implementation.git
   cd RVC_Implementation
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Prepare your dataset by following the guidelines in the `data/README.md`.

## Usage
### Training
1. Configure your dataset paths and hyperparameters in `config.yaml`.
2. Start training with:
   ```bash
   python train.py --config config.yaml
   ```

### Inference
To perform voice conversion:
1. Prepare input audio files (source and target) in the `inference` folder.
2. Run the inference script:
   ```bash
   python inference.py --config config.yaml --input input.wav --output output.wav
   ```

## Architecture
This implementation is based on modern deep learning techniques, including:
- **Feature Extraction**: Extracts speaker-independent features from audio.
- **Speaker Embedding**: Embeds target speaker characteristics for conversion.
- **Generator Network**: Synthesizes target speaker's voice.
- **Discriminator Network**: Enhances audio quality with adversarial training.
